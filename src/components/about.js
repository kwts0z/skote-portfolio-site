          <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <p>I’m Georgios Georgakis, a game audio sound designer from Athens, Greece.</p>
          <p>My passion for audio began at an early age when I started playing drums and recording music with friends. I went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Music Technology & Acoustics. During my Bachelor’s degree, I discovered the magic of sound design and I got passionate about game audio. This is why I relocated to Leeds and graduated from the Sound and Music for Interactive Games master’s program at Leeds Beckett University to further explore game audio design and the video game industry. I also love connecting with like-minded people, and I regularly attend game industry events such as the Leeds Games Toast, Game Audio Nexus, Game Audio Symposium or the Develop:Conference.</p>
          <p>To date, I’ve been involved with a couple of indie titles such as Carbonflesh and Selini, alongside pursuing several personal projects, university assignments, and enthusiastically participating in game jams.</p>
          <p>I revel in the creative freedom this field offers and I love the power of procedural sound design. As for my preferred tools, I tend to favor Reaper for sound design, and Wwise for implementation.</p>
          <p>I am currently looking to join a dynamic audio team to produce great and unique audio experiences.</p>
